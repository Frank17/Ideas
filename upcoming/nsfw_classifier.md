Hello world!

OK this isn't necessarily a weird one considering its practicality. The idea is to:
- Build a binary classifier that is able to tell nsfw text/images (including screenshots) /videos/audios/etc. from sfw ones. Group them into 2 clusters.
- Put the nsfw cluster to one folder and sfw cluster to another. Folders are specified by the user. (use something like `glob`)

I imagine Python to be the ideal language for this program —— but do as you pleased. It matters not the language (they're merely tools), but the way you utilize it and the functionalities the program has to offer.
- the same goes for other ideas I may or may not post on this repo
